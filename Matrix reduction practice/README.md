```Row Reduced Echelon Form Practice Platform


An interactive platform designed to help users practice and learn Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) reduction through hands-on matrix manipulation. The platform includes real-time feedback and tools for performing row operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling.

üöÄ Features
Interactive Matrix Manipulation: Perform common row operations, including row addition, subtraction, multiplication, and swapping.
Real-Time Stopwatch: Tracks the time taken to solve the matrix.
Backend Validation: Communicates with a Flask-based API to check if the matrix is in reduced row echelon form (RREF).
Responsive Design: Optimized for all devices using modern UI technologies.
Keyboard Shortcuts: Apply operations quickly using the Enter key and other intuitive controls.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend
Next.js: A React-based framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation for better performance and SEO.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive designs with ease.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and better development experience.
React Hooks: For managing component state and lifecycle events.
Backend
Python Flask: Serves as the backend API that processes matrix operations and checks for RREF validation.
Flask-CORS: Allows secure cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.
Numpy: Used for efficient matrix computations in the backend.
Other Tools
Fraction.js: For precise handling of fractional values in matrix computations.

Built with Github Copilot for efficiently writing code and comments
